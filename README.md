# Q1-Project-Spoilers-Podcast:

***UPDATED 6/27/2016***

What my project demonstrated:
The goal of my project was to create a website for my podcast that allows users to listen to our podcast/tracks. And to have it automatically update the site as we add new songs to Soundcloud.

My project accessed the Soundcloud API to access the tracks from my podcast and append the DOM with the most recent tracks. The first API call to Soundcloud then calls the OMDB (IMDB's unofficial API) API and appends DOM with the Poster, Rating, Plot, and title.


Proposal:

- Project Description:
    - Create a website for my iTunes Published Podcast (hosted through SoundCloud) and access the SoundCloud API to have our tracks playable to visitors.
        - Podcast description: Me and 3 good friends co-host a podcast that reviews film/movies
        - Checked SoundCloud documentation and it is possible to do this
            - https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs
        - Very simple splash page to start; possible internal and external links
        - In process of buying domain name and also looking to use Firebase (or another web server host) to host the actual HTML/CSS/JS docs.
    - Podcast name: Spoilers!

- Technologies:
    - HMTL
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - Firebase/Hosting Site
    - Domain Registrar Site

- MVP:
    - Overall: Informational page for our podcast
    - Slightly-Detailed:
        - Users can find our podcast’s live page and listen to our tracks (alternative to using SoundCloud or iTunes directly).
        - Have information/‘get to know’ page or part on the “Core 4” Producers
        - Links to our sponsors/friend podcasts

- Features to Add:
    - Since this is a project that links to an actual published podcast that me and my friends/colleagues own and produce, I will continue to add features as my technical chops increase!
