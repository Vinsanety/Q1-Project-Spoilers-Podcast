# Q1-Project-Spoilers-Podcast

Proposal:

- Project Description:
    - Create a website for my iTunes Published Podcast (hosted through SoundCloud) and access the SoundCloud API to have our tracks playable to visitors.
        - Podcast description: Me and 3 good friends co-host a podcast that reviews film/movies
        - Checked SoundCloud documentation and it is possible to do this
            - https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs
        - Very simple splash page to start; possible internal and external links
        - In process of buying domain name and also looking to use Firebase (or another web server host) to host the actual HTML/CSS/JS docs.
    - Podcast name: Spoilers!

- Technologies:
    - HMTL
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - Firebase/Hosting Site
    - Domain Registrar Site

- MVP:
    - Overall: Informational page for our podcast
    - Slightly-Detailed:
        - Users can find our podcast’s live page and listen to our tracks (alternative to using SoundCloud or iTunes directly).
        - Have information/‘get to know’ page or part on the “Core 4” Producers
        - Links to our sponsors/friend podcasts

- Features to Add:
    - Since this is a project that links to an actual published podcast that me and my friends/colleagues own and produce, I will continue to add features as my technical chops increase!
