      <p class='bio'>Our dearest Pappy.. What <em>can't</em> be said about this bloke? He's the brains, heart & soul behind this operation. Known for his innate ability to sleep at any time, he can also befriend even the most dangerous and vicious of household cats. If he isn't eating Milk Steak (put that, she'll know what that is), drinking tallboy Old Style's, or traveling the globe for <em>"work"</em>, you can find him tuning into the Cubs on FM radio or majestically riding through St. Paul, Minne-snow-da (don't let him tell ya he's in Minneapolis).</p>

      <p class='bio'>Stevie just got married; big, big mistake (just kidding, we love you, Lauren!). Stevie, oh yeah that's his name, is our story teller. He's animated, funny, and enthusiastic. Always quick with a joke, Stevie is our light-hearted jokester with an incredible memory for film quotes and exuberant scene reinactments. "It's your joke, Stevie, go ahead, finish it."</p>

    <div class="textDiv">
      <p class='bio'>Vints, or Vance Refrigeration, loves to do anything outdoors. If he isn't bouldering in one of Colorado's amazing climbing areas, he's probably hiking to the summit of one of his favorite spots. Drinking whiskey from the bottle and on to his next adventure.</p>
